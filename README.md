###Design
* Started with wireframing and user stories.  I drew how I wanted the page layout to look and created the bug tokens.  Used psuedocoding to map out the program as detailed as I could, step by step through each user interaction and program reaction.  I organized the psudeocode into steps for the actual coding and then coded each step.  After getting the core game mechanics working I had a few people play test the game and I restructred some design elements and game mechanics according to their experiences.

###Next Steps
